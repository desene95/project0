	A piece of brilliance from the Belgian in the 75th minute unlocked an entrenched Sunderland backline to break the deadlock during this Premier League affair. From the left-hand side of the box, Origi wrapped his right foot around the ball to whip it into the far corner.

	Origi's first Premier League goal salvaged Liverpool a point in the 95th minute of a 2-2 draw with West Brom at Anfield. While not the most aesthetically pleasing of goals, the deflected strike was an early show of defiance in the Jürgen Klopp era.
